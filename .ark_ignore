# Ark ignore file format tries to keep things simple. 
# Here's what you need to know about it:
# - you add 1 entry per line
# - entries are case insensitive, so build, BUILD, and Build are all the same
# - # starts a comment, anything after this is ignored
# - * represents any amount of characters
# - ! at the start of the line represents an exclusion
#
# That's it! Here's some examples of it in use:
# build/               # ignore build/ folder in the root of the project and it's content
# saved/*              # ignore only the content inside saved/, the folder itself will not be ignored
# *.sln                # ignore any path that ends in .sln
# */win*/cache/*       # ignore anything inside a path that has /win and /cache/, e.g. ThirdParty/Deprecated/WIN32/cache/
# images/*.png         # ignore any .png inside images/
# !images/logo.png     # exclude images/logo.png, so this will not be ignored
# images/logo.png      # ignores images/logo.png (i.e. overrides the exclusion)
